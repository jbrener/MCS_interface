# MCS_interface
This is Visual Studio C# code for serial communication between a Windows PC and an Arduino Mega 2560. It was copied from a YouTube video
by Nick (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHeG3Gt6STE&t=220s) and this first version is identical to his. My intention is to modify the
the code so as to provide a front end for the MCS psychophysical method which has been set up on the Arduino board. The method will be
used to study intermodality simultaneity judgements. The Visual Studio code will run on a Windows PC connected to the Arduino by a USB
cable. Through this serial connection, the user will be able to set the parameters for the MCS procedure using a GUI on the PC to initiate
the procedure and to collect and analyze the experimental data from the Arduino.
